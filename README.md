# DumbassP

This is just a simple math evaluator made with a custom lexer, parser, and evaluator, along with error messages. Made this as a practice project for building a language albiet its on the simple side.

Each file's usage is going to be explained in a readme as I want this to be something I can look back on.

So in short
- The DumbassP.Tests folder are where the unit tests are.
- The DumbassP.Compiler is where the logic is basically. All the files to make the evaluator work is in there.
- The DumbassP folder is just the entry point. This way I can keep the logic and implentation separate.
